## Getting Started

This Application is built to provide a better access to the latest news
I have used these packages for different purposes :
  Provider package: for state management
  Sqfilte: for local database management 
  firebase_auth and firebase_core : for authentication and authorization 
  http: for api integrations

Note:
  The api link can expire so you can get a new one at : https://newsapi.org/
